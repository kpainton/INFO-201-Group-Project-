                  Institute.  The Shark Research Institute is a scientific
                  research organization founded in 1991 in Princeton, New
                  Jersey. It was created to sponsor and conduct research on
                  sharks ensuring and bringing awareness to their conservation.
                  This dataset aims to explore the significance of interactions
                  between sharks and humans in comparison to the wide variety
                  of dangers we are exposed to in our daily lives. Humans are
                  not a prey to sharks, this dataset aims to give a better
                  understanding of interactions between humans and sharks
                  to minimize the risk of being injured by a shark and focusing
                  on the importance of conserving all shark species. The
                  datasetâ€™s objective is to illustrate the actual threat that
                  sharks present to humans, to convey the message that these
                  creatures are not at all aggressive towards humans but our

                 target audience to focus on. Researchers who gather this data
                 conducted personal interviews with medical personnel, victims
                 and witnesses to obtain a first-hand account of this incident.
                 After forensic analysis is conducted on the incident, it can
                 then be reported accurately through the media to answer the
                 public's question of whether the stereotype of sharks
                 naturally attacking humans is true or merely a misconception.
                 If proven a false stereotype, the mediacan inform the world
                 (their target audience) that sharks are not as dangerous as
                 the general population thinks.")
