                  research organization founded in 1991 in Princeton, New
                  Jersey. It was created to sponsor and conduct research on
                  sharks ensuring and bringing awareness to their conservation.
                  This dataset aims to explore the significance of interactions
                  between sharks and humans in comparison to the wide variety
                  of dangers we are exposed to in our daily lives. Humans are
                  not a prey to sharks, this dataset aims to give a better
                  understanding of interactions between humans and sharks
                  to minimize the risk of being injured by a shark and focusing
                  on the importance of conserving all shark species. The
                  datasetâ€™s objective is to illustrate the actual threat that
                  sharks present to humans, to convey the message that these
                  creatures are not at all aggressive towards humans but our

                 of whether the stereotype of sharks naturally attacking
                 humans is true or merely a misconception.

                    in the late mornings to afternoons from 1100hrs to
                    1530hrs. This is most probably contributed to the 
                    fact that most human activity or sports occur at this
                    time. More specifically, these attacks occur in the
                    afternoon at about 1400hrs. With higher frequency of
                    activities, comes a higher probability of any form of
                    provocation or attacks as such this data makes sense.
                    Reading the graph this finding is rather consistent
                    whether month or day. Even by changing the range of
                    years, the results are still consistent that attacks
                    occur at that timing. However the results become more
                    inconsistent as we go further back in time. This could
                    be due to the less comprehensive data collection methods
                    in the past. Thus, we will study the data using the whole
                    range of time period. Moving forward from here, a possible
                    recommendation is to not have too much activity at
                    that time to induce less shark attacks as the high
                    volume of visits to these areas may have been seen
                    as a form of provocation by the sharks."),

                    focusing on Months, we found that the period from
                    June to September proved to be the deadliest months.
                    This is with the time range since 1900 to the present
                    year. If we varied the range, it seemed to be random,
                    thus we by studying the entire time range, gave
                    a more consistent, credible and comprehensive result.
                    With June to September as the deadliest months, this
                    seemed to make sense as Summer season encourages more
                    people to engage in water activites. The higher
